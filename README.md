# OpenGLTestProject2D
A simple OpenGL practice project created while following The Cherno's tutorial series. This repository contains my first experiments while learning the basics of modern OpenGL.
 ðŸ“ŒSetting up an OpenGL environment with GLFW and GLEW
ðŸ“Œ Working with shaders, buffers, and textures
ðŸ“Œ Using ImGui for real time testing and debugging
ðŸ“Œ Basic transformations with glm

In the future, I plan to update this project with batch rendering.
